# Welcome to Dekini

For shippers, we understand that getting goods from one place to another at the rigth time and budget is very difficult. And for vendors(Shipping agencies), making services availble to potential shippers is a major problem. Also records management of shipping and invoicing is still done with paper manually and its time consuming.

Dekini is here to connect shippers to the right vendors, reducing the time for negotiation and dealing times. Dekini provides a dashboard for shipping agencies and businesses and individuals alike for their freight dealings.

The timing of Dekini couldn't be better. It is here to eliminate all the hassle it takes to import from the shipping to clearing.
